# Jump Game
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

>The array `A` contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1, 𝑎2, …, 𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤5000) (1≤n≤5000)

## Example1
Input:
```
A = [2,3,1,1,4]

```
Output:
```
true

```
Explanation:
```
0 -> 1 -> 4 (the number here is subscript) is a reasonable scheme.

```

## Example 2
Input:
```
A = [3,2,1,0,4]

```
Output:
```
false

```
Explanation:
```
There is no solution that can reach the end.

```

## Challenge

This problem have two method which is `Greedy` and `Dynamic` Programming.

The time complexity of `Greedy` method is O(n).

The time complexity of `Dynamic` Programming method is O(n^2).

We manually set the small data set to allow you pass the test in both ways. This is just to let you learn how to use this problem in dynamic programming ways. If you finish it in dynamic programming ways, you can try greedy method to make it accept again.

## Approach

转移方程:

       设 f[j] 表示青蛙能不能跳到石头 j


                   枚举上一个跳到的             最后一步的
                       石头 i                 距离不能超过 ai
                         |                      |    
                         |                      |    
          f[j] = OR (0 <= i < j) (f[i] AND + a[i] >= j]
            |                       |        
            |                       |
         🐸 能不能                 🐸 能不能
         跳到石头j                 跳到石头i         



   Time Complexity:  O(N^2)
   Space Complexity: O(N)

```

## Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param A: A list of integers
     * @return: A boolean
     */
    public boolean canJump(int[] A) {
        // corner case
        if (A.length == 0 || A.length == 1) {
            return true;
        }

        // state
        int n =  A.length;
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n];
        dp[0] = true;

        // function
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(dp[j] && A[j] >= i - j) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```
